Textbook on Economics of Ageing

I've been writing an introductory textbook on economics of ageing for a while, in Latex with figures and tables in R. 
This is my first attempt at knitting it all together via RStudio and making it available in the cloud following Christopher
Gandrud's excellent book "Reproducible Research with R and RStudio".

The textbook is NOT meant primarily or exclusively for undergraduates of economics but more generally for anyone interested in 
the economic determinants, effects and consequences of individual and population ageing.
